# XP Core Values

Our team embraced two key XP Core Values throughout the project:

## Communication

Communication was a critical success factor in our project. We established multiple channels to ensure seamless information flow among team members:

1. **Regular Meetings**: We held weekly scrum meetings where team members shared updates, discussed challenges, and aligned on goals. These meetings provided a structured forum for face-to-face communication.

2. **Daily Check-ins**: Though we didn't conduct formal daily standups, we maintained a practice of daily check-ins via our team communication channel to share quick updates and flag any issues.

3. **Documentation**: We documented API specifications, architectural decisions, and user stories comprehensively. This documentation served as a single source of truth for the team and reduced misunderstandings.

4. **Code Reviews**: Pull request reviews became a valuable communication channel where team members shared knowledge, explained implementation decisions, and provided constructive feedback.

5. **Cross-functional Collaboration**: Despite our specialized roles (Pooja on backend, Alekhya and Viswa on frontend, Teja on cloud infrastructure), we encouraged knowledge sharing across domains. For example, frontend developers consulted with backend developers on API design, ensuring the interfaces met the needs of the UI components.

6. **Stakeholder Communication**: We maintained open communication with our project advisor, providing demos and gathering feedback at the end of each sprint.

The effectiveness of our communication was evident in several ways:
- Minimal integration issues between frontend and backend components
- Quick resolution of blockers through timely communication
- Consistent understanding of project requirements across the team
- Smooth handling of requirement changes with minimal disruption

## Feedback

Feedback was deeply embedded in our development process, enabling continuous improvement:

1. **Iterative Development**: We divided our project into four sprints, with each sprint culminating in a potentially shippable increment. This approach allowed us to gather feedback early and often.

2. **Code Reviews**: All code changes underwent peer review before merging. These reviews fostered knowledge sharing and ensured code quality and consistency.

3. **Testing Feedback**: Automated tests provided immediate feedback on code changes, helping identify issues early in the development cycle.

4. **Sprint Reviews**: At the end of each sprint, we conducted a review to demonstrate completed features, gather feedback, and reflect on what went well and what could be improved.

5. **UI/UX Feedback**: We conducted internal usability testing on new UI components, gathering feedback from team members not involved in the development of those components.

6. **Retrospectives**: After each sprint, we held retrospectives to reflect on our processes, tools, and collaboration. These sessions helped us identify improvement opportunities and implement changes in subsequent sprints.

The feedback loops we established had tangible benefits:
- Early detection and correction of design flaws
- Continuous improvement of our development processes
- High-quality code through regular peer reviews
- User-centered design decisions informed by usability feedback
- Team growth through continuous learning and adaptation

By prioritizing communication and feedback, we created a collaborative environment that enabled us to deliver a high-quality restaurant booking system that met the needs of our stakeholders while maintaining a sustainable development pace.
